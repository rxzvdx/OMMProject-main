# SWE Team 6:
# Joseph, Tyler, Antonio, Ross, Kashan, Gavin
# File: submit_data.py
# Purpose:  
#   1.) Handles the submission of exam data, including the state of each question.
#   2.) Extracts the questionStates from the incoming JSON file and saves it to the session.
#   3.) For the last question in the list, it retrieves the score and time, storing them in the session if available.
#   4.) Inserts each answer into the database by calling insertAnswer for each question's state.
#   5.) Updates the exam attempt with the final score, completion status, and time taken by calling updateAttempt
#       then returns a success message in JSON format.
